# Techdegree Project 2 with Search

Project 2 challenges students to paginate objects dynamically based on user search. This project pushed the boundaries of my abilities, but I was able to develop a working product.

Many thanks to Team Treehouse for this challenge, which fell on the cutting edge of my zone of proximal development. The HTML and CSS were provided by Team Treehouse.

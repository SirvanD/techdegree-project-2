# Techdegree Project 2 with Search

Wow, this project was a major challenge! I was able to complete the 'meets expectations' portion fairly quickly, but figuring out the implementation of the search field while managing the buttons was a massive project in and of itself for me.

That said, after many, many hours, copious cognitive strain, and plentiful periods of stuckness, I finally completed a fully-functional, error-free project (so far as I can tell).

I look forward to your feedback. Thanks in advance!

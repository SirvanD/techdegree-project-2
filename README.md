# Techdegree Project 2 with Search

This version of project 2 includes a functioning search box. My version of the search updates each time the user
changes the input in the search field. It continuously tests search input against arrays of name chunks.

Having learned more about the capability of .includes(), I may do this differently in the future. Regardless, I
feel this product represents a significant advance in my capabilities. Thanks for the good challege.

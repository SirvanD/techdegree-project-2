# Techdegree Project 2 with Search

I'd like to thank the Team Treehouse team for setting up this
project, which usefully strained my mind toward considerable growth.
While I feel certain a Guil H. or other such creature could find 100 ways to refactor my code toward greater syntactic beauty, I am at least satsified that this presentation works to a presentable degree.

At the time of this writing, there is one error that I am not yet able to diagnose and which does not seem to effect behavior. It occurs when clicking the last or second-to-last pagination button, and I hope to determine its cause and remedy it soon.
